## Problem
Consolidate and standardize content identifiers across partners at global scale.

## Constraints
- Partner SLAs (Google, Apple, Roku, Amazon)
- Large data migration with zero downtime

## Approach
Service decomposition, DynamoDB modeling, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and robust observability.

```

## Architecture
Serverless compute, DynamoDB, event-driven sync, metrics/alerts with Grafana and incident response.

## Results
- **25% overhead reduction** after migration
- **1M+ records** migrated safely
- **Improved partner reliability** via standardized APIs

## What I'd Do Next
Introduce schema registry and end-to-end contract tests for integrations.
